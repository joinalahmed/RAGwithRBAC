## 3. Annual Budget Planning

### Key Components
- **Salaries**: Based on the salary bands outlined above.
- **Benefits**: Calculate the expected costs associated with health insurance and provident fund contributions.
- **Total Headcount**: Estimate the number of employees at each level to determine total payroll expenses.

### Example Calculation:
Assuming a headcount of:
- IC1: 20 employees
- IC2: 15 employees
- IC3: 10 employees
- IC4: 5 employees
- M1: 5 employees
- M2: 3 employees

#### Total Salary Estimate:
```
IC1: 20 * Avg(500k-800k) = 20 * (650000) = ₹13,000,000
IC2: 15 * Avg(700k-1200k) = 15 * (950000) = ₹14,250,000
IC3: 10 * Avg(1100k-2000k) = 10 * (1550000) = ₹15,500,000
IC4: 5 * Avg(1800k-3500k) = 5 * (2650000) = ₹13,250,000
M1: 5 * Avg(1500k-2500k) = 5 * (2000000) = ₹10,000,000
M2: 3 * Avg(2000k-3500k) = 3 * (2750000) = ₹8,250,000
```

#### Total Salaries:
```
Total Salary Expense = ₹13M + ₹14.25M + ₹15.5M + ₹13.25M + ₹10M + ₹8.25M = ₹74.25M
```

#### Annual Benefits Estimate:
```
Health Insurance Cost = (total headcount) * (sum insured)
= (63 employees) * (500,000) = ₹31.5M
```

#### Total Annual Budget:
```
Total Annual Budget = Total Salary Expense + Annual Benefits Estimate
= ₹74.25M + ₹31.5M = ₹105.75M
```
