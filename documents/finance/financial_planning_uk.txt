### Categories of OPEX

2. **Variable Expenses**: Costs that vary directly with production volume (e.g., materials, utilities).
3. **Semi-variable Expenses**: Costs that have both fixed and variable components (e.g., maintenance contracts).

### OPEX Management Strategies

- **Regular Review**: Conduct monthly reviews of OPEX against budget forecasts.
- **Negotiation with Suppliers**: Seek better terms or discounts from suppliers.
