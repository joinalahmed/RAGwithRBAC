**Confidential HR Documentation: Compensation Guidelines**

**1. Salary Bands and Structures**

**Objective:** Establish clear salary bands to ensure internal equity and external competitiveness.

**Salary Bands:**
- **Band 1:** Entry Level (e.g., Interns, Trainees)
  - Salary Range: $40,000 - $55,000
- **Band 2:** Junior Level (e.g., Coordinators, Assistants)
  - Salary Range: $55,000 - $70,000
- **Band 3:** Mid-Level (e.g., Specialists, Managers)
  - Salary Range: $70,000 - $90,000
- **Band 4:** Senior Level (e.g., Senior Managers, Directors)
  - Salary Range: $90,000 - $130,000
- **Band 5:** Executive Level (e.g., VP, C-suite)
  - Salary Range: $130,000 and above

**Structure:**
- Salaries within each band should be aligned based on experience, education, and performance.
- Annual salary reviews should be conducted to adjust bands based on market trends and internal equity.

**2. Performance-Based Compensation**

**Objective:** Link compensation to individual and organizational performance.

**Performance Metrics:**
- Individual Performance Metrics (IPM): Based on annual performance reviews, assessing achievement against pre-defined KPIs.
- Team/Department Performance Metrics (TPM): Based on the performance of the team or department as a whole.

**Formula:**
- Total Performance Bonus = Base Salary x Performance Multiplier
  - Performance Multiplier: Defined as follows:
    - Exceeds Expectations: 1.20
    - Meets Expectations: 1.00
    - Below Expectations: 0.80

**3. Bonus Calculation Methods**

**Objective:** Incentivize employees through structured bonus programs.

**Annual Bonus Structure:**
- Target Bonus as a percentage of base salary:
  - Band 1: 5%
  - Band 2: 10%
  - Band 3: 15%
  - Band 4: 20%
  - Band 5: 30%

**Bonus Calculation Formula:**
- Annual Bonus = Base Salary x Target Bonus Percentage x Performance Multiplier

**Example Calculation for Band 3 Employee:**
- Base Salary = $80,000
- Target Bonus = 15% = $12,000
- Performance Multiplier = 1.20 (Exceeds Expectations)
- Annual Bonus = $80,000 x 0.15 x 1.20 = $14,400

**4. Equity Compensation Policies**

**Objective:** Attract and retain talent through equity ownership in the company.

**Types of Equity Compensation:**
- Stock Options
- Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

**Vesting Schedule:**
- Standard vesting period of four years with a one-year cliff.
- After the cliff, equity vests monthly over the remaining three years.

**Equity Calculation Example:**
- For an employee receiving options worth $50,000:
  - Number of options granted = Value of Options / Strike Price
    - Assume Strike Price = $10; Number of Options = $50,000 / $10 = 5,000 options.

**5. Executive Compensation Framework**

**Objective:** Provide a competitive compensation package to attract and retain top executives.

**Components of Executive Compensation:**
- Base Salary
- Annual Cash Bonus
- Long-term Incentives (LTI) â€“ Stock Options or RSUs
- Benefits and Perks

**Executive Salary Structure:**
- Salaries determined by benchmarking against similar organizations:
  - CEO: $200,000 - $500,000
  - VP Levels: $150,000 - $300,000

**LTI Calculation Example:**
- LTI granted as a percentage of base salary:
  - CEO: 100% of base salary in stock options/RSUs.
  
**Total Executive Compensation Formula:**
- Total Comp = Base Salary + Annual Cash Bonus + Long-term Incentives + Benefits Value
