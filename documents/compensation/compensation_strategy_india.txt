- Promote an open dialogue regarding pay structures and adjustments to enhance trust within the organization.

### 5. Performance-Based Compensation

Design and implement a performance-based compensation system that aligns individual contributions with organizational goals:

- Establish clear KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for each role.
- Use a tiered bonus system where employees can earn bonuses based on performance ratings.
- Provide annual salary increments based on performance reviews to reward high performers.
  
### 6. Long-term Incentive Plans

Implement long-term incentive plans (LTIPs) to motivate employees to contribute to the company's success over the long term:

- Offer stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs) for key positions.
- Design LTIPs with vesting schedules to encourage retention and align employee interests with company performance.
- Consider profit-sharing schemes that reward employees based on the company's profitability.

Through clear salary bands, job family frameworks, market competitiveness analysis, pay equity guidelines, performance-based compensation mechanisms, and long-term incentive plans, the organization will be well-positioned to foster a motivated and skilled workforce. Regular reviews and adjustments will be crucial to maintaining the effectiveness of this strategy over time.
